# Network Training for the Active Alarm Project
This repository contains the code I used to train a CNN model to identify situp completion as an introduction to neural networks.
## Overview 
- A class controlling the import and access to data is implemeneted in [ImportData.py](https://github.com/THartigan/AATraining/blob/main/importData.py).
- Notebook [2_visualisations.ipynb](https://github.com/THartigan/AATraining/blob/main/2_visualisations.ipynb) was used for visualisation of gyroscope data in 3D space, with limited success.
- Notebooks index 3-4 are then responsible for the training and evaluation of the trained model.
- Notebook [5_exporting.ipynb](https://github.com/THartigan/AATraining/blob/main/5_exporting.ipynb) is then responsible for taking the trained model and outputting it in a simplified form which can be executed locally on an Apple Watch.
